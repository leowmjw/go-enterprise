## Title What is Enterprise Software?

- Enterprise software is designed to meet the needs of organizations rather than individuals.
- Features scalability, robustness, and integration across different systems.
- Example: Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing service, supports data analysis at scale.

## Title What is Enterprise Software? (No, Really, What Is It?)
  - Imagine software that’s like an office superhero, except it’s mostly stuck in meetings all day.
  - It's supposed to solve big, complicated business problems (and justify equally big budgets).
  - Snowflake, our hero in the cloud, doesn’t just store data—it hoards it like a digital dragon sitting on a goldmine.

## Title ChatGPT's Definition: Now with Extra Sambal!
  - According to ChatGPT (and who’s more reliable than a robot?), enterprise software is like nasi lemak of business tools.
  - It's essential, versatile, and complex—perfect for feeding the whole company's data appetite.
  - Just like how every state in Malaysia claims they have the best version, every software vendor swears their solution is the top choice.


## Title Challenges in Enterprise
  - Managing scheduled tasks across distributed systems is a common challenge.
  - Cron jobs are often used for scheduling, but lack dynamic control and scalability.
  - Authorization complexities increase as systems scale and integrate.

## Title What is wrong with Cron?
  - Cron provides limited error handling and no retry logic.
  - It lacks support for real-time monitoring and logging.
  - Difficult to scale and manage in distributed, cloud-based environments.

## Title Solution with Temporal
  - Temporal offers a robust platform for managing workflows and activities.
  - Handles retries, error handling, and state persistence seamlessly.
  - Scales dynamically with enterprise needs, providing observability and control.

## Title Authentication vs Authorization
  - Authentication is verifying a user's identity, while authorization determines access levels.
  - Both are critical in securing enterprise applications.
  - Often confused, but each plays a distinct role in security frameworks.

## Title What is OpenFGA?
  - OpenFGA is an open-source fine-grained access control system.
  - It allows developers to define and enforce authorization policies dynamically.
  - Suitable for complex, multi-user, and multi-role environments.


## Title Temporal x OpenFGA Integration
  - Integrating Temporal with OpenFGA facilitates just-in-time authorization.
  - Enhances workflow security by dynamically applying access controls.
  - Ideal for environments where permissions need to adapt quickly to changes.
